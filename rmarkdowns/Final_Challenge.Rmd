# Introduction

HÃ¥fa Adai (Hello in CHamoru)!

Guahu si Frank Lujan (My name is Frank Lujan). 

I come from Guam, a small island territory in the Western Pacific, which is part of Micronesia. 

```{r Location of Guam}

world <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")

## Hospitals on Guam 

```{r Hospital of Guam}


install.packages("leaflet")
library(leaflet)

install.packages("osmdata")
library(osmdata)


```
```{r}

available_features()

```

```{r}
# we will create a boundary box (bb) around Guam 
guambb <- getbb("Guam")
guambb

guambb %>%
  opq()
```

```{r}
guam_hospital <- guambb %>%
  opq() %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = "building", value = "hospital") %>%
  osmdata_sf()

guam_hospital
```
```{r}
# guam metadata
guam_hospital$meta
```

```{r}
# osm_polygons
guam_hospital$osm_polygons
```

```{r}

leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(
    data = guam_hospital$osm_polygons,
    label = guam_hospital$osm_polygons$name
  )
```

### Figure 2: Locations of hospitals found around Guam. 

In Figure 2, locations of hospitals (in blue bounding boxes) are found on Guam. The data was collected using the osmdata library package which looks into features such as hospitals. 


Though the interactive map indicates that there are two hospitals, Guam Memorial Hospital is a public hospital found in Tamuning (https://www.gmha.org/). The Naval Hospital, located in Agana Heights, prioritizes getting appointments for those identified in Dept. of Defense's policies such as active duty service and family members (https://guam.tricare.mil/Getting-Care/Appointments-Referrals). Additionally, there are limitations within the dataset as it does not include an additional acute care hospital in Dededo (https://www.grmc.gu/). However, Guam does not have any hospitals located in the southern villages. Because of the lack of infrastructure for individuals and community members in this area, future recommendations is to provide infrastructure such as urgent care facilities to these areas to provide healthcare facilities. 

## Invasive Species of Guam 

In this section, we will be using iNaturalist data for Guam. I will be comparing the amount of coconut palm tree observations are found compared to an invasive species, *Oryctes rhinoceros*, the coconut rhinoceros beetle.

```

```{r}
# using the rinat library, we will be using the taxon and place ids that you can retrieve from the URL link when you search for a specific species and area of study

### Figure 3: Coconut Palm Tree observations found on Guam. Using the iNaturalist API, we used the taxon id in the URL link to create the map. 

In Figure 3, we can see the number of coconut tree observations indicated in blue dots. These dots are geo-referenced areas where citizen scientists have found various trees around the island. An important feature of the code limits the amount of results that it pulls from the API (n = 100). An interesting aspect of this map shows that for the number of observations noted, a high number of observations were located in south eastern coasts of the island, with one observation found in Cocos Island. Although the dataset shows that the coconut tree's range is around the island, a limitation of the dataset is that it does not take into account and separate the trees into healthy versus unhealthy trees. Unhealthy trees are those that have been attacked and affected by the coconut rhino beetle. A recommendation would be to conduct various surveys around the entire island, either using drone imagery or in situ measurements, to determine the amount of coconut trees left healthy. This is important to know since the different parts of the tree are important in CHamoru culture such as weaving.

### Figure 4: Coconut Rhino Beetle Observations on Guam. Data was retrieved using the iNaturalist API for the taxon id = 320058. 

Figure 4 shows the number of observations (n = 100) of coconut rhinoceros beetles (CRB) around Guam. Looking at the map, we can see that the central area of the island has more occurrences compared to those found in the southern half of the island. Another interesting pattern found in the data is that it shows that not all CRB observations were primarily adults. One limitation of the dataset is that the samples found on the map are not those found within the wild. This may be considered because it does not indicate where exactly the sample was initially found and whether it was found near its host tree. A recommendation is to increase educational outreach on CRB and provide ways for residents to control the spread of CRB around the island.
